  with thrust and equities that lie behind this curtain of information. (You don’t need to lift up the curtain to see who owns it). The insurance principle. The mirror (Register) is deemed to give the absolute correct reflection of title, but if through human error a flaw appears, anyone who suffers los must be put in the same position, so far as money can do, that he would have been in had the reflection been a true one. (If there is a problem on title the government will pay to resolve this). Right of survivorship. The right of survivorship is an important aspect of joint tenancy in that the interest of the deceased tenant (Owner) in automatically transferred to the surviving tenant (Owner).

While the letter of opinion does not detail the research, analysis and all the conclusions, the file on the valuation must include this information in order to support the valuation. 8. Subjective value states that value exists in the minds of buyers and sellers. True. In subjective value, the key is to look at what people are willing to pay for a property irrespective of what it costs to produce. People will base what they are willing to pay on what other people were willing to pay for similar properties. 9. The subjective concept of value dominates in real estate valuation. True. This concept is used in the Direct Comparison Approach which is used as the primary approach in valuing residential homes. 10. Market price and market value would always be the same. False. There are situations where a buyer might overpay for a property (Sold their home and are desperate to fine anothe
 r home quickly) or underpay for a home (Seller is in financial difficulties and needs to sell quickly at any cost). 11. John is thinking of paying $10,000 more for 123 Main Street than for 125 Main Street because it has a fireplace and central air conditioning nor found in 125 Main Street. This is an example of the principle of anticipation. True. John is looking at the present value of something (The fireplace and central air conditioning unit) that he anticipates that he will enjoy in the future (I.E. when he moves into the property). 12. The definition of highest and best use is “that use which at the time of the appraisal is most likely to produce the greatest net return in money or amenities to the building over a given period of time. False. Highest and best use applies to the use\"}","trigger_field_values":"{\"time\":\"21:45\"}"},{"created_at":"2015-10-23 14:58:42 -0700","normalized_applet":{"id":"29270824d","name":"If every day at 09:30 PM, then call my phone at 00

A quit claim deed can be an expedient method to resolve a mortgagor’s financial difficulties by vesting all rights associated with the property to the mortgagee. True. A quit claim deed can be effective in this situation, but the mortgagee should be cautious because any existing problems are transferred along with the rights. 2. Under the land titles, the curtain principle states that the register of title accurately and completely reflects current facts about a property title. False. The description provided describes the mirror principle, not the curtain principle. 3. The charge/Mortgage of land can only be used to register mortgages under land titles and not registry. False. The Charge/Mortgage of land is used in both land titles and registry. 4. While the basis for modern land description was originally ba
 sed on lots and concessions, this approach is no longer used as electronic registration requires that properties be identified by lot and plan number. False. Legal descriptions based on lot and concession are widely used in rural areas. 5. Title insurance policies are primarily designed for tow target markets. Lenders and owners. True. Policies and scope of coverage’s for these two audiences will vary by lender. 6. A survey is not required when a buyer obtains title insurance. False. Title insurance may eliminate the need for a survey, but that will depend on the property and the title insurer. 7. The seller’s solicitor must undertake a title search of the property and provide a list of outstanding encumbrances to the buyer. False The buyer’s solicitor, not the sellers solicitor, undertakes a title seach of the property being purchased. 8. Non title search items could include compliance with zoning and the existence of any work orders. True. The two examples highlighte
 d are non title search items. The range of such items will vary by property and individual circumstances. 9. The seller’s lawyer is responsible for preparing a draft transfer/deed of land in preparation for closing a residential transaction. True. The seller’s lawyer also prepares the statement of adjustment. 10. The electronic conversion of land registry records is driven by two systems. Teraview and teranet. False. The two systems are polaris and teraview.
